  abstract = {Speech quality is an important measurement for performance evaluation
	in a wireless mobile communication system since voice is still the
	most used service on it. The speech quality evaluation in GSM system
	employing narrowband and wideband AMR codecs with Orthogonal Sub
	Channel (OSC) technique is addressed in this paper. OSC is a feature
	proposed in 3GPP GERAN to double circuit switched capacity in GSM
	networks. It has introduced two new channel modes, namely Double
	Full-rate (DFR), and Double Half-rate (DHR), which have doubled capacity
	when compared to legacy AMR channel modes.Many of the efforts in
	standardization are concentrated on studying hardware improvements
	lead by AMR DHR usage over AMR HR channel mode. Although AMR DFR
	has not brought hardware efficiency improvements over legacy channel
	modes, in this paper it is shown that speech quality is improved
	over AMR HR with the same blocking capacity; therefore it is a good
	solution for some interference limited networks. Furthermore, we
	also investigate the speech quality of wideband AMR DFR codecs which
	provides a substantial improvement when compared with narrowband
	AMR.},

  abstract = {Re-farming of 900 MHz band into HSPA has been started and is likely
	to happen later with LTE. Typically operators have less than 10 MHz
	block of 900 MHz spectrum and therefore co-existence of two systems
	in that band is causing challenges. One of the major issues is the
	high GSM voice traffic that will remain in the GSM network. How to
	cope the same traffic with significantly less bandwidth for GSM?
	Orthogonal Sub-Channel (OSC) is a new method to increase voice capacity
	in the GSM system. OSC intends not only increase the GSM voice capacity
	but enables very efficient usage of hardware and spectrum resources.
	In this paper a detailed analysis on OSC performance is made based
	on system level simulations. Aim is to provide results that show
	how OSC can be used for refarming of the 900 MHz band into HSPA or
	LTE. Simulations are carried in the GSM network evaluating capacity
	for different bandwidths and site configurations. Released frequency
	spectrum can be used for HSPA or LTE to provide good coverage for
	rural area mobile broadband. Results show that OSC is an efficient
	method to release resources for the new systems.},
